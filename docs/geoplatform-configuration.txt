When configuring the Geoplatform to accept data from a mobile application, the first step is to create a custome Featured Service.

Creating a custom feature service can only be achived under https://developers.arcgis.com/layers/. 
When creating a new layer, you must define the fields and field types.
Once a featured service is created, it cannot be updated.

After creating a new featured service, adjust the settings as follows:
Enabling Editing
<enabled>

Keep track of who created and last updated features
<enabled>

What kind of editing is allowed?
<Only add new features>

What features can editores see?
<Editors can't see any features, even those they add>

What features can editors edit? 
<Editors can only edit thier own features (requires tracking)

What access do anonymous editors (not signed in) have?
<Only add new features, if allowed above (requires tracking)

Ensure that the new featured service is shared with Everyone (Public)

Create a new view that shares the columns that you want shared. You can now create maps based on that view.
